# elda

the set of commands you need to run from your terminal after cloning the repo are as follows (to run the app on android)

1. npm install
2. npm start or npm run android

In case the system environment is not set up, please refer https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup. 
I have attached an apk file in the repo for your reference.

PS. I have missed out on separating the constant files for the static strings that are used and might have missed cleaning up at places.
